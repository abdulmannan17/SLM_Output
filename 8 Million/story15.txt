Once upon a time, there was a big race. All the animals wanted to win the race. The prize was a soft mattress. The student was so happy. But then, the cheery soldier said, “You have to do something for me. You have to complete the race first.” The student was so sad. But the cheery soldier said, “Don’t worry. I will help you.” The cheery soldier and the cheery soldier worked together. They worked hard and completed the race. The cheery soldier was so proud of the cheery soldier. The cheery soldier said, “You did it! You completed the race!” The cheery soldier smiled and said, “Yes, I did. I am so proud of myself.”
