Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to go to the store to buy sweets with her mom and dad. On this special day, Lucy entered the store with her mom and dad, feeling so excited. “Mmm, this is so yummy!” Lucy said with a smile. Her parents smiled back and said, “Yes, it is. We are so proud of you.” Lucy beamed with pride and hugged her parents. She was so happy to have completed her first task.
