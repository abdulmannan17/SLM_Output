Sara and Tom were having lunch with their mom. They liked to eat pasta with cheese and tomato sauce. Mom gave them each a fork and a plate. Sara and Tom said thank you and started to eat. But Tom was not very hungry. He played with his fork and made funny noises. But then, Sara and Tom’s mom said, “We’re going to have to go now. We have to finish our lunch first.” Sara and Tom’s eyes widened. They had forgotten to finish their lunch before they had finished their game. The moral of the story is that it is important to finish your lunch before doing something. If you finish your lunch, you can have a successful day.
