Once upon a time, in a warm and sunny place, there was a big pit. A little boy named Tom liked to play near the pit. One day, Tom lost his red ball. He was very sad. Tom asked his friend, Sam, to help him search for the ball. They looked high and low, but they could not find the ball. Tom said, "I think my ball fell into the pit." Sam and Tom went close to the pit. They were scared, but they wanted to find the red ball. They looked into the pit, but it was too dark to see. Tom said, "We must go in and search for my ball. ?" Sam and Tom laughed and said, "Yes, we will find your ball." The two friends went inside the pit and searched for the ball. After a while, they found it! Tom was so happy and said, "Thank you, Sam. You are a good friend." The moral of the story is that it is important to help others when they are in need.
