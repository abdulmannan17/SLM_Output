Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges with their blocks and cars. Tom was very proud of his tall tower. He wanted to make it even taller, so he reached for more blocks. "Tom, can I have some blocks too?" Lily asked. She wanted to make a bridge for her cars. "No, these are mine. Go find your own," Tom said. He did not want to share with his sister. fullly, Tom was very unhappy. Lily was very sad and angry. She wanted to play with Tom, but he was not sharing. She decided to go and find Tom. She walked around the house, looking for something else to do. She saw a big box in the corner. She opened it and saw a lot of toys. She was very happy. She took out the toys and started to play with them. Tom saw Lily playing with his toys. He was very angry. He ran to her and shouted, "Lily, what are you doing? Those are my toys! You are not allowed to play with them!" Lily was scared. She dropped the toys and ran away. She did not want to make Tom angry. She did not want to make him mad. She just wanted to play. Tom and Lily hugged each other. They were still friends. They decided to play with the toys together. They had fun. They did not fight anymore. They were happy.
