Lily and Tom were twins who liked to decorate things. They had a big box of crayons, stickers, and glitter. One day, they found a shiny copper pot in the kitchen. It was Mom's pot, but she was not home. Lily and Tom wanted to make it more pretty. But then, Lily's dad came home and saw the pot. He was angry and said, "That pot is not for painting! It is for cleaning!" Lily and Tom were sad, but they knew it was the right thing to do. The moral of the story is that it is important to be responsible and responsible. Even if something looks beautiful, it is still important to be responsible.
