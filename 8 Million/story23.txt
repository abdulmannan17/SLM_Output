Peter was walking beside a wild river. All of a sudden he saw a bright mineral in the water and decided to reach for it. He bent down and as he reached for it, he felt a splash of cold water on his face! "Oh no!", he exclaimed. He felt something slimy beneath his toe and he saw a small fish. The moral of the story is that it is important to be careful and not do something that could be dangerous.
