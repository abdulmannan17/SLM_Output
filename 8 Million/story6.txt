Once upon a time, there was a king. He was a big and strong king who ruled over his kingdom. One day, full of the student’s story was over. The king was very angry and he shouted at the student. He said, “You must not do this again!” The student was very scared and he ran away. He never returned to the university again. The moral of this story is that it is important to be careful and not do things that are not yours. It is important to be honest and respectful.
