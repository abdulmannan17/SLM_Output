One day, a little girl named Mia was in the kitchen with her mom. Mia's mom was making pasta for dinner. Mia was very hungry and wanted to eat the pasta. Mia’s mom, who was not happy, said, “No, Mia. You need to eat your dinner first.” Mia was sad, but she knew her mom was right. She ate her dinner and then she went back to playing. The moral of the story is that it is important to listen to your parents and do what they say. If Mia had not listened to her parents, she would have been punished.
