Once upon a time, in a small house, there lived a little boy named Tim. Tim was an intelligent boy who loved to learn new things. One day, Tim's mom came home with a surprise. She had a big smile on her face when she saw the student. She said, "Look, Tim! I have a surprise for you!" Tim was so excited to see what the surprise was. His mom presented him with a brand new toy car! Tim was so happy and thanked his mom for the wonderful gift. He hugged her and said, "Thank you for the best exercise ever!"
