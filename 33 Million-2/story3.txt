Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to go to the store to buy sweets with her mom and dad. On this special day, Lucy entered the store with her mom and dad, feeling so excited. Lucy was so happy to see the student and she ran over to give her a hug. She was so surprised to find out that she had won a prize! She was so excited that she ran around the store, showing everyone her prize. Lucy was so proud of herself for completing the exercise and she couldn't wait to tell her friends about it.
