Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play outside in the sun. But one day, the sky is not clear. It is dark and gray. Sara and Ben hear a loud sound. It is thunder. Sara and Ben run out of ideas. They look at each other with fear in her eyes. They scream and run away. Sara and Ben run to their house. They slam the door behind them. They hug each other and cry. They are glad they are safe. They are glad they have each other. They are glad they have exercise.
