Papa Bear was feeling very tired and he decided to relax on the porch. Mama Bear was there too, watching the tall trees sway in the wind. "This is so nice," Papa Bear said with a smile. Pleased with the student, the student grabbed his toy gun and shot at the trees. The student screamed in pain, but Papa Bear just laughed. The session ended and the student went back to relaxing on the porch.
