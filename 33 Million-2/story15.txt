It was a sunny day and two friends decided to travel. They were so happy to be able to take a journey together. There was an interesting boat near ously in the whole world. Sara was so proud of her discovery. She ran up to the student and said, "Look! It’s a piñata!" The student smiled and said, "Yes, it sure is! Let's open it and see what’s inside!" Sara opened the rod and revealed a bunch of candy. The student's eyes lit up and she shouted, "Yay! Candy!" Sara smiled and said, "See, I told you it was a success!"
