Tom and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to build towers and bridges with their blocks and cars. Tom was very proud of his tall tower. He wanted to make it even taller, so he reached for more blocks. "Tom, can I have some blocks too?" Lily asked. She wanted to make a bridge for her cars. "No, these are mine. Go find your own," Tom said. He did not want to share with his sister. t of them were too big for them. Tom and Lily were sad. They wanted to play with their blocks, but they were too small to make them feel better. They decided to share their blocks with each other. They both had a lot of fun and had a great time.
