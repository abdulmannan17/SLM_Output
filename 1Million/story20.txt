Once there was a boy who loved playing in the mine. Every day he would fill up his bucket with dirt and rocks. Then he would run to the wealthy man's house to show him what he found. of the teacher was so happy to see him. The student was so proud of his work and thanked the teacher for the help. He was so proud of himself for being so brave and grateful. From then on, the teacher and the student were the best of friends.
