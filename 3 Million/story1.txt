Once upon a time, in a warm and sunny place, there was a big pit. A little boy named Tom liked to play near the pit. One day, Tom lost his red ball. He was very sad. Tom asked his friend, Sam, to help him search for the ball. They looked high and low, but they could not find the ball. Tom said, "I think my ball fell into the pit." Sam and Tom went close to the pit. They were scared, but they wanted to find the red ball. They looked into the pit, but it was too dark to see, and then Tom had an idea. He said, "Let's find the red ball!" So, Tom and Sam searched the pit and found the red ball. They were so happy! They thanked the pit and went back to playing.
