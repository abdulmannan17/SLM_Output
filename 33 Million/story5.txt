Lily and Tom were twins who liked to decorate things. They had a big box of crayons, stickers, and glitter. One day, they found a shiny copper pot in the kitchen. It was Mom's pot, but she was not home. Lily and Tom wanted to make it more pretty. Lily and Mom looked at the pot and smiled. They hugged each other and laughed. Lily said, "Look, Mom! We made this for you!" Mom said, "It's beautiful! I love it!" Lily and Tom were so happy. They hugged Mom and thanked her for the special gift.
