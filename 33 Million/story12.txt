She had been working so hard, but now she felt something was wrong. She looked up at her mom and dad and said, "I can't do it." Her mom smiled and said, "It's ok, Sue. You can do it. Just keep trying." Sue smiled and tried again. This time she was able to complete the task. She was so proud of herself. She hugged her mom and dad and said, "I did it!" Her mom and dad smiled and said, "Yes, you did. You are so thoughtful." Sue was so happy. She had learned a new skill and she was proud of herself. She hugged her mom and dad and said, "Thank you!"
