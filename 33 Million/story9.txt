Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She lived in a small, tidy house with her mom, dad, and her dog, Max. Lily was so happy to see her parents. She ran over to them and hugged them. "Hi Lily!" said her mom. Lily smiled and said, "Hi!" Lily and her parents spent the rest of the day playing with Lily's toys and having fun. By the end of the day, Lily was so happy that she had learned about exercise.
