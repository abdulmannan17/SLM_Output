One morning, a cat named Tom woke up. He felt happy because the sun was shining. Tom ran out of energy and congratulated Lily for teaching him a valuable lesson. Lily smiled and said, "See, Tom? Exercise can be fun and rewarding. We should always try new things!" Tom nodded and agreed with Lily. From that day forward, Tom and Lily exercised together and learned the importance of knowledge.
