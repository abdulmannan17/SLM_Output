Once there was a little girl called Sarah. She was three years old. She got a costume for her birthday. It was a very special costume. Sarah was so happy to have her own costume. She ran to show her mom. "Mommy, look! I have a costume!" Sarah shouted. Her mom smiled and said, "That's wonderful, Sarah! You look so cute in your costume." Sarah was so excited to show her costume to her friends. She ran around the house, showing everyone her costume. Everyone was so impressed with her costume. Sarah was so proud of her costume and she was so happy that she had completed it.
