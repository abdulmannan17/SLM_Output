Once upon a time there was a little girl named Lucy. She loved to go to the store to buy sweets with her mom and dad. On this special day, Lucy entered the store with her mom and dad, feeling so excited. Lucy was so happy to see the student and she ran over to give her a hug. She was so surprised to see the student, she couldn't help but smile. The student and Lucy quickly became friends and spent a lot of time together. Lucy was so glad she had entered the gym and learned a new language.
